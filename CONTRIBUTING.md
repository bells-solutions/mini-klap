## Development Setup

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Code Style

### Backend (NestJS/TypeScript)

- Follow the existing NestJS patterns
- Use dependency injection
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use TypeScript types, avoid `any`

**Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class VideoService {
  constructor(
    private configService: ConfigService,
    private transcriptionService: TranscriptionService,
  ) {}

  async processVideo(videoId: string): Promise<VideoResponseDto> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Frontend (Vue.js/TypeScript)

- Use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use Pinia for state management
- Follow Vue.js style guide

**Example:**
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import type { Video } from '@/types/video'

const videos = ref<Video[]>([])
const isLoading = computed(() => videos.value.length === 0)
</script>
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests
npm run test:cov      # Coverage
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests
```

### Adding Tests
